# Types of events

## Summary

This document summarises the different types of hybrid events and maps them

Just for reference the [wikipedia article for hybrid events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_event)

## An event we would consider:
- time limited,_not_ ongoing: yes training, no undergrad courses; _what about things like the Open Life Science programme_?

> [name=Jez Cope] Would Open Life Science programme be a series of such events? So the individual events would be in scope?
> [name=Emmy Tsang] but each individual event would benefit from loads of pre-existing relationships, exercises/assignments beforehand, and familiarity with format
> [name=Jez Cope] :thumbsup: definitely a different type of thing
> [name=Emmy Tsang] proposing to move to boundary section below... nope, forget this, does not have a physical component :laughing: 
> 

- each physical pod has to have more than 1 person to be considered a physical pod

## Examples of hybrid events

- [Gallantries](https://galaxy-carpentries.github.io/gallantries/about) classes (up to 20) in multiple locations, helpers in the classes, instructors teaching remotely, using: Zoom, Google Docs, Gitter
- [Mozilla Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/)
- Collaborations Workshop :grinning_face_with_star_eyes: 
- THE Port hackathon: main hackathon is a 3 day in-person experience, but for 5-6 weeks before it teams meet online roughly once a week
- RDA Plenary 15: moved from being an in-person event to being an online event where keynotes were streamed at the time where they originally planned, and group sessions took place online in an extended two week period, with varying timeslots to accomodate timezones, it also included remote poster session
- Carpentries instructor training. Used to be few locations, with multiple people in each location and trainers teaching remotely. Have been changed into all learners joining separately.
- Computing for High-energy physics (CHEP) 2019: week long conference almost entirely in-person but talks were recorded and posted online afterwards
- [NL-RSE meetup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SdZCzMeynDuyFfaERPNpDg14QEdYCO3zPyhBlcadJHc/edit#heading=h.843bj68sanxq) usually happens in person, but have been moved to online, due to covid-19
- The [Pan-european Quantum Internet Hackathon](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/ulka_athale_1/take-part-in-pan-european-quantum-internet-hackathon): took place in many distrubted "nodes" around Europe all in late-October 2019
- [Climate-KIC's Climathon](https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/): Many cities around the world hosting climate-related hackathons (though not all around coding) all taking place within a few weeks and only loosely connected
- British Library reading group (in fact many BL internal meetings): multiple attendees split between two rooms on different sites
- Recent online-only Carpentry courses (e.g. Library Carpentry w/s series at BL)

- 


### Examples of things that are *definitely not* hybrid events

- UKSG Conference (UK libraries procurement: heavily predicated on f2f interaction between librarians and suppliers)
- FORCE2019: F2F only, all talks recorded
- eLife's online research talks
- Most webinars
- E.g. Open Data Day, where local satellite events are organised but no single central channel

## Examples of boundary events
- at the eLife Innovation Sprint for the last 2 years we had 1-2 groups (out of 14) that looped in a few remote collaborators â€“ they all knew each other beforehand. The call (for remote contributors) was not very explicit.
    - 2 full days, 60 physically people + 5/6 remote all in their own individual pods
    - digital tools: Slack, GitHub, Twitter, gSuite
- Previous Collaborations Workshops: took place in-person, but use of twitter to keep people engaged with main workshop, and then we have had remote participants working on the hackathon projects (waves at Jez as an example ðŸ‘‹)
    - 3 full days, 90 physical people + 5
- RDA Plenaries (the normal ones, not the latest virtual only one) [That's not entirely true, as they allow remote access to working group sessions, and I've joined remotely in the past] [name=Patricia] Thus boundary for me, I know in Helsinki, many remote connections just didn't work
- csv,conf,v4 â€“ all talks were live-streamed and people interacted with participants on twitter
    - 2 full days, 150-200 physical +  Idk how many remote interacters there are
- Columbia University Webinars: you present in a physical room to a small physical audience, but most of the audience and questions come from a virtual audience
- Python for High-Energy Physics (PyHEP) 2019: Two talks given remotely but everything else was in-person. Questions from physical audience were relayed to speakers
- Early OpenCons (2015 and 2016 editions); similar to csv, conf I think with streams
- In-person events that are streamed online, with comments used to get remote interaction
    - E.g. Twitch live-streaming
- Traditional conferences which have remote presenters (example bidiversity_next)
- an event attended with telepresence robot

## Types of hybrid events

- Possible axes
    1. Peer interaction: "traditional" is mostly broadcast e.g. a presenter to an audience vs "unconference" is mostly talking to each other in smaller groups 
    2. Synchronicity: does everyone connect / engage at the same time or are do aspects run at different times, depending on participant availability, etc 
    3. Facilitated: the amount of coordination and control exerted by the organisers (or is this more a type of mechanism?)
    4. Objectives: swapping information or knowledge, getting to know people (networking), or co-creation (e.g. a hackathon) (Is this similar to the first point?)
    5. Length and audience size
    6. Location / geographic distribution of audience
    7. Tooling types
    8. Pod size statistics: mean and variance

    9. types of interaction: video, voice, text, pictures/whiteboards, games
